# Password Manager
It's a CLI password manager. The following operations are supported:
* list all labels associated with passwords
* add / update password
* remove existing password
* show password for the given label
* update encryption key

Each operation requires input of the encryption key currently used.

# TODO
Password DB is stored locally.  
There are plans to use cloud for passwords storage.
